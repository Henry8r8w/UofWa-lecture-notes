### Tools
Observable, p5*js, tableau, VL, Javascript

### What to Expect
Weeks 1–3: Establish Foundations
- Build core knowledge and technical vocabulary
- Develop key reference points for further learning
Weeks 4–10: Master Tools & Technologies
- Hands-on focus on practical tools
- Apply foundational concepts to real-world scenarios

### Course Goals
1.Understand key visualization 
techniques and theory
2. Design, evaluate, and critique 
visualizations
3. Wrangle, explore, and explain 
datasets using visualization
4. Implement interactive data 
visualizations & understand best 
practices
5. Learn prominent visualization 
tools/toolkits


### Why Visualize?
1.To the Invisible, Visible
- Reading: Gallop, Bay Horse “Daisy” Muybridge 1884-86
    - notice how the horse hoove and think about how horses run

2.To promote awareness, inform behavior
- Reading: The Deisgn of Eco-Feedback Technology

3. To Advance Undesrtading Through Interactive Inquiry

4. To Combine Art + Data
### Why Not Just Analyze The Data
Without visualization, you might get rolled with the data itself
Reading: Same Stats, Different Graphs: Generating Datasets with Vraied Appearanced and Identical Statitiscs thorough Simulated Annealing

Takeaway: a T-rex pattern data can have the same summary statsiics with a star pattern data (horror)

### Exploratory Vis - > Explanantory Vis
we go from understanding the data to interpret the data, then to present the data
### So, What is Visualization?
" Data visualization is the graphical representation of 
information and data. By using data encodings and 
visual elements, visualizations provide a way to see and 
understand trends, outliers, and patterns in data"
- Tableau

"Visualization is the use of computer-generated, 
interactive, visual representations of data
to amplify cognition"
- Reading In Information Visualization by Stuart Card, Ben Shneiderman, and Jock Mackinlay

"The human visual system is a pattern seeker of enormous 
power and subtlety. The eye and visual cortex of the brain form 
a massively parallel processor that provides the highest 
bandwidth channel into human cognitive centers"
- Colin Ware -- visualization Professor and author, UNH
Information Visualization Perception for Design (3rd Edition)

"Computer-based visualization systems provide visual 
representations of datasets designed to help people carry 
out tasks more effectively. Visualization is suitable when there is 
a need to augment human capabilities rather than replace 
people with computational decision-making methods"
- Tamara Munzner -- Visualization professor and researcher, UBC
Visualization Analysis & Design, 2015, p. 1

### How might we design a visualization that emphasizes Bolt’s speed relative to other Olympians?
We see an increasing trend of athelte apporaching usain bolt record based on the visualization
- Time encoded on the y-axis
- X-acis encoded time behind usain bolt
- Circle mark the time of finishing
- Colors represent medals
