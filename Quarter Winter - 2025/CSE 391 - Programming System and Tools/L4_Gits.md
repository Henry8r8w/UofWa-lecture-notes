### The four phases of git

### Version Control and Repositories
A repository (or repo) in git is a location that stores a copy all files. 

What should be in a repo?
- Rule of thumb: everything you need to build the project from source
- Source code: .java, .c, .py files
- Build and configuration files: Makefile, build.xml, packages.json
- Assets (e.g., images) & documentation
What should not be in a repo?
- Rule of thumb: things you can build from source
- Object files: .class or .o files
- Executables: .exe or .app files
