### Course Objectives


[Programming System and Tools](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse391/25wi/)
- Being able to 
    - Read, write, and navigate commands in a Unix command-line shell.
    - Manage Unix file system concepts including permissions, groups, and users.
    - Chain Unix pipes and redirection for complex information management tasks.
    - Connect to remote servers and use multi-user shared Unix systems.
    - Compose regular expressions and related tools for efficient search.
    - Filter, substitute, and otherwise process string and text context.
    - Utilize git version control including merging across multiple branches.

Causal Inference
- Explain how economists think about causality in terms of counterfactual worlds and causal effects. Converse fluently in the language of causality in economics. This includes treatment,
outcome and control variables, potential outcomes, treatment effects, and to be able to apply
these general concepts to specific economic problems.
- Explain the conditions under which a regression line represents a causal effect instead of a
simple correlation. To reason logically about whether the conditions are plausible or not in
any specific economic setting.
- Develop an intuitive understanding of methods that economists use for causal inference, and to explain how the methods can isolate causal effects. These include matching, difference-in-difference, synthetic controls, instrumental variables, and regression discontinuity design.
- Differentiate between causal and statistical inference. Explain the importance of random sampling from a population. Explain what we can (and cannot) learn from a confidence interval, from machine learning

Introduction to Digital Design
- Introductory course in digital logic, Boolean algebra, combinational and sequential circuits, combinational and sequential logic design, and programmable logic devices

[Hardware and Software Interface](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse351/25wi/syllabus.html)
- Describe the multi-step process by which a high-level program becomes a stream of instructions executed by a processor;
Describe the basic organization of the memory hierarchy and the effect of its parameters on system performance;
- Trace the execution of assembly code (x86-64), map the assembly to high-level language constructs, and write simple pieces of assembly programs;
- Write C code using pointers to create and manipulate data structures;
- Write (or rewrite) code to take advantage of the computer execution model to improve execution efficiency;
- Debug small-ish C and assembly programs using GDB;
- Perform basic navigation and file system operations in Linux using a terminal;
- Explain the basic role of an operating system in executing processes;
- Identify some of the ways that computers and their design principles affect society today.

[Data Visualzation (Dropped)](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse412/25wi/)
- Understand the value of visualization
- Critically evaluate visualizations and suggest improvements and refinements
- Use principles of perception and graphic design to create effective visualizations
- Learn how to use visualization as a communication tool
- Conduct exploratory data analysis and transform data
- Use modern tools and toolkits such as Observable, Tableau, p5.js, and Vega-Lite

Professional Issues (for EE)

    - After you graduate
    - Starting a job
    - Salary negotiation and realistic earning expectations
    - Should I go directly to grad school?
    - Ethical practice of engineering
    - Design of ethical autonomous agents
    - Patents and IP
    - Diversity and inclusion in the engineering profession
    - Starting a company
    - Social media and your professional identity
