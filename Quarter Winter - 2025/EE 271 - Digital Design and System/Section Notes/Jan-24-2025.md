### K-Maps (4 variables)
Example:
| CD/AB | 00   | 01   | 11   | 10   |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| 00    |   1    |       |   1    |   1    |
| 01    |       |       |   1    |   1    |
| 11    |       |       |       |    1   |
| 10    |       |       |   1    |    1   |

- Ending Result: NOT(C)NOT(D)NOT(B) + NOT(C) A+ NOT(D) A + A NOT(B)

Rules
- When transition takes place, there are six transition possibilities  with two outcomes (variable remain/ disappearance) in the bits outcome that corresponding to the K-map variables (ex. AB/ CD)
    - 00 $\to$ 01: (\text{NOT(A)NOT(B)} \to \text{NOT(A)} \)
    - 00 $\to$ 11: \( \text{NOT(A)NOT(B)} \to \text{B} \) 
    - 00 $\to$ 10: \( \text{NOT(A)NOT(B)} \to \text{NOT(B)} \)

    - 01 $\to$ 11:\( \text{NOT(A)B} \to \text{B} \)
    - 01 $\to$ : \( \text{NOT(A)B} \to \text{NOT(B)} \)

    - 11 $\to$ 10: \( \text{AB} \to \text{A} \)



You should expect a group of 4 should result a 2 variables ending (an arbitrary visualization example: ABCD $\to$ AC)

4 variables box grouping (matrix notation, {AB, CD} notation)
- ex. $a_{22}, a_{32}, a_{23}, a_{33} \leftrightarrow \{01,11\}, \{01,10\}, \{11,11\}, \{11,10\}$, which by observation we see 
 transition of CD eliminate one variable (e.g., D)  and transition from AB also eliminates one variable (e.g., A)

4 corners grouping
- $a_{11}, a_{14}, a{41}, a_{44}$
- notice how A and C gets eliminated

4 variables row/column grouping
- $a_{11}, a_{21}, a{31}, a_{41}$
- Notice how AB will always be NOT regardless of what C and D are
    - because we jump from 00 to 01 to 11 to 01, the transition cancels out
2 variables row/column grouping
- $a_{11}, a_{21}$
- your AB remains not and you will realize the transition of D, making  NOT(A)NOT(B)NOT(C)

Note: when the boolean equation is in partial POS or SOP form, you need to ensure that the forms of the boolean equation can be converted to make your filling of K-Map to be consistent
