### RCM: Potential Outcomes


### RCM: Setup
RC has two key elements, variously named:
- teatment/intervention/causeindepednetn variable
- Outcome/reponse/depednetn variable


### Causality: RCM
- Potential Outcome Model is also known as the Rubin Causal Model (RCM)
    - RCM is the framework for the inference and estimation of causal effects in statistics (named in recognition of Rubin). It handles both situations with experimental as well as observational variation in the cause. As such, the RCM is ideally suited to showcase how RCTs are a way to avoid the selection problem
    - We conclude by establishing a link between the RCM and the traditional linear regression-based study of selection bias as applied to the inference and estimation of causal effects
