You will provide your solution to this homework by editing the collection of
functions in this source file.

INTEGER CODING RULES:

  Replace the "return" statement in each function with one or more lines of C
  code that implements the function. Your code must conform to the following
  style:

  int Funct(arg1, arg2, ...) {
      /* brief description of how your implementation works */
      int var1 = Expr1;
      ...
      int varM = ExprM;

      varJ = ExprJ;
      ...
      varN = ExprN;
      return ExprR;
  }

  Each "Expr" is an expression using ONLY the following:
  1. Integer constants 0 through 255 (0xFF), inclusive. You are not allowed to
     use big constants such as 0xFFFFFFFF. However, you are allowed to combine
     constants to produce values outside this range (e.g., 250 + 250 = 500) so
     long as the operator you are using to combine the constants is listed as
     "legal" at the top of the method you are writing.
  2. Function arguments and local variables (no global variables).
  3. Any operators listed as "ALLOWED" in the function header comment of the
     method you are writing.
  4. Casting.

  Some of the problems restrict the set of allowed operators even further.
  Each "Expr" may consist of multiple operators. You are not restricted to one
  operator per line.

  You are expressly forbidden from:
  1. Using control constructs such as if, do, while, for, switch (unless
     otherwise stated).
  2. Defining or using macros.
  3. Defining additional functions in this file.
  4. Calling functions (unless otherwise stated).
  5. Using operators listed as "DISALLOWED" in the function header comment of
     the method you are writing.

  You may assume that your machine:
  1. Uses 2s complement, 32-bit representations of integers.
  2. Performs right shifts arithmetically.
  3. Has *undefined* behavior when shifting by a negative amount or an amount
     greater than or equal to the number of bits in the value being shifted.
     (i.e., x >> n is undefined when n < 0 or n >= *size of x*)
     (e.g., if x is a 32-bit int, shifts by >= 32 bits are undefined)
     Undefined behvaior means that the result of the operation may change in
     different environments -- this should be avoided.
